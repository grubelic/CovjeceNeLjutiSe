infoView|General Info:NNN - This program is designed for testing and comparing bots for "Mensch, argere dich nicht" game (bots' requirements in pdf in ./res subfolder).NNN - The bots can compete in three modes: Single game, Tournament and League. Single game displays board. In Tournament and League modes bots compete in matches (multiple games) to reduce factor of luck and compare programmer's strategies.
